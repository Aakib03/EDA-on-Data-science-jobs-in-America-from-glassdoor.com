# EDA-on-Data-science-jobs-in-America-from-glassdoor.com
This project as on data cleaning and EDA of glassdoor jobs(Data Science only) in America.
I got the data from ken jee's youtube channel. Where he scraped through glassdoor's website to collect the data.
It is interesting to know how data science salaries varies through industries, location, seniority and many other interesting variables.
